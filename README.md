# Simple Text Editor: the basics of procedural and structural programming
## üéØ **Purpose of work**
Understand the basics of procedural and structural programming by having hands-on experience
in using these paradigms. Learn how the memory management works inside the process,
understand the virtual memory concept and typical issues with memory allocation and
deallocation, learn the basic data types.

## üìã **Task**
Develop a console-based text editor that will have the below functionality:
1. Append text symbols to the end
2. Start the new line
3. Use files to loading/saving the information
4. Print the current text to console
5. Insert the text by line and symbol index
6. Search (please note that text can be found more than once)
7. (Optional) Clearing the console <br />
In this case you should clean the console before each command start.

# üìù **Control questions**
1. What is structural programming paradigm?
2. What is procedural programming paradigm?
3. Which primitive data types do you know? Key differences between them?
4. Which segments does the process memory have?
5. What is the virtual memory space?
6. How to allocate the memory in each segment?
7. How to reallocate the memory in case we don‚Äôt have enough space?
8. What is a runtime stack?
